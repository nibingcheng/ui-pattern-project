# UI Element Project

This is a Javascript programing course project.

## Project Objective 

The goal is to fulfill all the requirements given by the instructor. 

## UI patterns and API

There are a number of UI patterns as well as APIs to choose from for the project by each 
individual. I choose to implement the tabs pattern and the data to populate the UI Pattern
comes from the NASA's astronomy picture of the day.  

## instructionss

Open the `index.html` file (~/sei/projects/mini-project-3/ui-pattern-project/lib) using a
web browser. 

- A row of four tabs above a content area shows four consecutive days. When the user clicks on 
  one of the tabs, i.e. a particular date, the program will send a requst to NASA and upon 
  receiving the data package, the content in the content area will be updated. 
  
- The contents include an astronomy and space science related image along with a brief explanation, 
  both of which are part of the NASA data received. Meanwhile, the the tabs clicked would chang to
  a different shade of color.

- At the top left corner of the page, the user can submit a specific date (must be after 1995-06-16).
  Then the dates shown in each tabs will be updated. The user can click on the date submited or
  any of the three days after that to see the content.

- When the user loads the page, a random date is generated by the program and the data from the 
  API load into the UI pattern on the screen.

## Note

- The initial loading of the page capable of seeing the data from the API was implemented sucessfully.
  However, due to the fact that I get http 400 error randomly and for the purpose of reducing the number
  request to the NASA API, it was changed to load a picture in the computer's local storage.
